# FizzBuzz Dart Program

This Dart program generates the FizzBuzz sequence for a user-specified range of numbers. It demonstrates the classic FizzBuzz logic with user input handling for flexible range selection.

## How it Works

- The user specifies the start and end values for the range.
- The program iterates through each number in the range and applies the following rules:
  - Prints **"FizzBuzz"** for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.
  - Prints **"Fizz"** for numbers divisible by 3 but not 5.
  - Prints **"Buzz"** for numbers divisible by 5 but not 3.
  - Prints the number itself if none of the above conditions are met.

## Features

- Accepts dynamic ranges through user input.
- Implements the FizzBuzz logic with clear and structured output.
